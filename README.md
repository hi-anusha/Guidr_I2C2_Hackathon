# Guidr
 A complete guide - "from the student to the student"
 
The recent days, there has been significant changes, especially in the educational and industrial sectors. The enormous number of layoffs are taking place due to recession and difficulties are faced by students due to the closing down of their institutes. This has inspired us to do something about it.

Guidr brings the two sectors together. With their verified credentials, now the mentors can upgrade their skills by mentoring students and in-turn learn new things aswell. Students get to work on hands-on projects under these skilled mentors to thrive in a competitive job market.

Mentors earn a small amount as a reward and gain points for helping out students with their projects. Top students also get a chance to have a 1:1 virtual coffee chat with a recruiter.

Students can verify their skills by taking our assessments. Students are also encouraged to help out their peers buy answering to their questions.

Recruiters get to network with potential candidates with proven skills as demonstrated by their mentorships.
